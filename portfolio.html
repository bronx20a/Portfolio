<h2 class="about-title">Who I am</h2>
<p class="about-description">My name is Tony, I am a recent college graduate from New England. 
I learned web design during the pandemic and I have honed my skills to bring my ideas to life. I am 
the founder of The Central Post, which is a news analysis blog that I designed and published. Since the site's launch,
I have published eighteen articles across three genres with new content published weekly.</p>
<p class="about-description" style="padding-top: 0px">I graduated from undergraduate study in May 2020, <em>Magna
    Cum Laude</em>, with a degree in Business and Politics. During my undergraduate career,
    I conducted extensive research into economic and political trends both domestic and abroad. I received
    high honors for my thesis research, which focused on African American political participation
    in southern states after the repeal of certain provisions of the Voting Rights Act.</p>
